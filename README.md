# Simple-Weather-App-Javascript

This is an exercise project, implemented by calling the weather data from the openweather api.

In total, there are two ways to get weather information.
1. query based on the entered city name
2. Use the browser's own geolocation function to get the longitude and latitude to query

The weather icons are displayed based on the 6 categories of open weather, and the weather id returned by the api determines which icon is displayed.
